# Account-level Capability Host for Foundry Agent Service (Hosted Agents).
#
# Hosted Agents require an account-level capability host with public hosting
# environment enabled. This resource type is not yet available in the azurerm
# provider, so we use the azapi provider with the ARM API directly.
#
# Why azapi_resource (not azapi_resource_action):
#   azapi_resource waits for the Managed Environment provisioning to complete
#   before returning. azapi_resource_action only fires the PUT and returns
#   immediately, which causes agent deployments to fail with a timeout error
#   because the environment is not yet ready.
#
# Destroy handling:
#   The capabilityHosts API does not support DELETE. Before running
#   `terraform destroy`, remove this resource from state:
#     terraform state rm azapi_resource.capability_host
#
# Use API version: 2025-10-01-preview
#   NOTE: The official docs still reference 2025-10-01-preview as of 2025-03-31,
#     but 2025-12-01 is the GA version listed in the ARM template reference.
#   NOTE: New version is 2025-12-01 (GA).
#     The 2025-10-01-preview version is required to avoid a "The request is not valid" error.
